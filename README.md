# Notes for ZTM_Python Bootcamp

## Section 3
* Working with Integers and Floats as well as math fundamentals. 
* DON'T read the dictionary -- that is what Googling is for...
* operator precedence (PEMDAS)
  * Parenthesis ()
  * Exponents **
  * Multi / Div ( * or / )
  * Add / Sub ( + or - )
* Binary Numbers
  * print(bin(5)) returns 0b101
  * print(int('ob101', 2)) returns 5
* Variables (snake_case)
  * start with lowercase oe underscore
  * can't overwrite keywords
  * Capitalize variable to represent constants
* augmented assignment operator
  * example (+=) shorthand or (-=)
    * some_value = 5
    * some_value = some_value + 5 or...
    * some_value += 5
* Types of Variable
  * str = string (text in quotes) also (''' for long strings)
    * f strings  print(f"hi {name}. You are {age} old")
    * [start:stop:stepover] use negative (-) to go in reverse (string slicing)
    * parts of strings can't be reassigned only completely changed
  * int = integer (whole numbers)
  * float = numbers with decimals
  * bool = booleans (TRUE / FALSE)
  * list = append / extend / pop / remove / clear
  * check keywords in docs / W3 schools
